# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analytics

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that perform data analytics on the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. The analysis explores various aspects of sleep health and lifestyle choices, using multiple data exploration techniques and visualization libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the [Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset?fbclid=IwY2xjawFyFGdleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHRVv12nitaTUXUUR1gIOhIqcxP-PtIMkMCBp1xFfOmmLZd57nD_x81d5tw_aem_75R2S4_5Hi25h2R-0hHVeQ) from Kaggle. This dataset includes various attributes related to sleep quality, lifestyle factors, and health metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:**
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and analysis.
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): For numerical computations and data manipulation.
  - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/): Specifically, `scipy.stats` for statistical analysis.
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): For plotting and visualizations.
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): For statistical data visualization.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** 
  - Basic statistics and data summary.
  - Identifying missing values and data cleaning.
  
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Hypothesis testing and correlations using `scipy.stats`.
  
- **Data Visualization:** 
  - Distribution of sleep quality.
  - Correlation between lifestyle factors and sleep health.
  - Visualization of trends and patterns in the dataset.
